## Blood standard panel, Urinalysis and other lab tests and observations
### Loinc
[Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®)](https://loinc.org/downloads/) is clinical terminology that is important for laboratory test orders and results, and is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.

## Proteomics

### UniProt
[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) is the world’s leading high-quality, comprehensive and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information.
The UniProt Consortium - the universal protein knowledgebase in 2021
[Nucleic Acids Res. 49:D1 (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa1100/6006196)

## Metabolomics

### HMDB
[The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)](https://hmdb.ca/) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. It is intended to be used for applications in metabolomics, clinical chemistry, biomarker discovery and general education. The database is designed to contain or link three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data. The database contains 220,945 metabolite entries including both water-soluble and lipid soluble metabolites.

## Genomics

### Gene Ontology
[THE GENE ONTOLOGY RESOURCE](http://geneontology.org/)
The mission of the GO Consortium is to develop a comprehensive, computational model of biological systems, ranging from the molecular to the organism level, across the multiplicity of species in the tree of life.
The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase is the world’s largest source of information on the functions of genes. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is a foundation for computational analysis of large-scale molecular biology and genetics experiments in biomedical research.

## Exposome

[Exposome-Explorer](http://exposome-explorer.iarc.fr/downloads)
First database dedicated to biomarkers of exposure to environmental risk factors for diseases.
